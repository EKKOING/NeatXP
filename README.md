A look into applying the NEAT algorithm to the space combat simulator XPilot.

## Project Proposal
I will attempt to compare and contrast the use of GAs and smart GAs (NEAT) to evolve an ANN to control an XPilot agent. The former will be heavily based upon the work completed for Program #4, though new training will need to take place due to the error that occurred in the training for the competition. From my earlier findings, training will likely take close to 800 generations to reach near maturity for this pure GA, thus evaluation of NEATâ€™s performance will be done over the same generation period. If it is determined that the project would benefit from additional training time, and/or additional trials of the same length, they will be performed. The NEAT package that will be used in this project can be found here. Metrics will be logged across each generation as well as copies of the best performing agent at each generation for later analysis.  

## About Xpilot

*A Screenshot of an XPilot Game*  
>XPilot is an open-source 2-dimensional space combat simulator which is playable over the internet. Multiple players can connect to a central XPilot server and compete in many varieties of game play, such as free-for-all combat, capture-the-flag, or team combat. Each player controls a space-ship that can turn, thrust, and shoot. There is often a variety of weapons and ship upgrades available on the particular map in which they play. The game uses synchronized client/server networking to allow for solid network play.

## About Genetic Algorithms
Genetic Algorithms are a form of computational intelligence that through mimicing the natural world's evolution can perform complex optimizations. This optimization is not performed through error correction, but rather through semi-random adjustments. 
The basic structure of a GA is as follows:
Create a population of individuals.
Evaluate the fitness of each individual in the population.
Select a subset of the population to undergo genetic operations.
Perform genetic operations on the selected subset.
Repeat steps 2 and 3 until a satisfactory solution is found.

## About NEAT
NEAT is a genetic algorithm that is specifically designed to solve the problem of evolving neural networks. It is a form of artificial intelligence that is used to solve problems that are difficult to solve using conventional genetic algorithms or backpropagation.
NEAT modifies the general GA structure by introducing a number of innovations to the GA. These innovations include:
 - The ability to modify the structure of the NN as well as the weights and biases of the NN.
 - Adding speciation, which allows individuals to only compete amongst those similar to them until the strategy can develop.

The former is the greatest strength of NEAT as it allows for the network to increase in complexity to meet whatever challenge is presented to the algorithm. The latter is a great help to ensuring that the algorithm does not suffer from the drawbacks of a standard GA being applied to a NN.

## Experimental Design
For this study the GA and NEAT will be tasked with solving the same task, controlling the Shellbot XPilot Agent in a 1 on 1 battle against a hand coded opponent written by me. Both algorithms will share the same inputs, actions, and fitness functions to try and keep the environments as similar as possible. Additionally, both algorithms will have the same population size and limits on the weights of each node.

### The Fitness Function
The fitness function of the agents is made up of two sub functions:

The first function is the score of the agent at the end of the evaluation period.  
The second function is assigned as follows:
 - 0.01 points for each frame the agent is alive
 - 0.03 points for each frame the agent is moving faster than 0.5 units

The final fitness of the agent is the sum of the two sub functions.
