# NeatXP
A look into applying the NEAT algorithm to the space combat simulator XPilot

## Project Proposal
I will attempt to compare and contrast the use of GAs and smart GAs (NEAT) to evolve an ANN to control an XPilot agent. The former will be heavily based upon the work completed for Program #4, though new training will need to take place due to the error that occurred in the training for the competition. From my earlier findings, training will likely take close to 800 generations to reach near maturity for this pure GA, thus evaluation of NEATâ€™s performance will be done over the same generation period. If it is determined that the project would benefit from additional training time, and/or additional trials of the same length, they will be performed. The NEAT package that will be used in this project can be found here. Metrics will be logged across each generation as well as copies of the best performing agent at each generation for later analysis.
