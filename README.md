A look into applying the NEAT algorithm to the space combat simulator XPilot.

## Project Proposal
I will attempt to compare and contrast the use of GAs and smart GAs (NEAT) to evolve an ANN to control an XPilot agent. The former will be heavily based upon the work completed for Program #4, though new training will need to take place due to the error that occurred in the training for the competition. From my earlier findings, training will likely take close to 800 generations to reach near maturity for this pure GA, thus evaluation of NEATâ€™s performance will be done over the same generation period. If it is determined that the project would benefit from additional training time, and/or additional trials of the same length, they will be performed. The NEAT package that will be used in this project can be found here. Metrics will be logged across each generation as well as copies of the best performing agent at each generation for later analysis.

*A Screenshot of an XPilot Game*  
>XPilot is an open-source 2-dimensional space combat simulator which is playable over the internet. Multiple players can connect to a central XPilot server and compete in many varieties of game play, such as free-for-all combat, capture-the-flag, or team combat. Each player controls a space-ship that can turn, thrust, and shoot. There is often a variety of weapons and ship upgrades available on the particular map in which they play. The game uses synchronized client/server networking to allow for solid network play.

## Experimental Design
For this study the GA and NEAT will be tasked with solving the same task, controlling the Shellbot XPilot Agent in a 1 on 1 battle against a hand coded opponent written by me. Both algorithms will share the same inputs, actions, and fitness functions to try and keep the environments as similar as possible. Additionally, both algorithms will have the same population size and limits on the weights of each node. 

The inputs provided to the respective networks are as follows:

| **Input**            | **Description**                                                                       |
